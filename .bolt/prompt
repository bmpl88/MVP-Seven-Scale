CONTEXT: I'm the founder of SevenScale, a premium consulting company specializing in automation and AI solutions for CLINICS AND MEDICAL OFFICES. I'm building a proprietary dashboard platform to differentiate my consultancy, increase average ticket (R$ 15-25k/month), and maximize client LTV (24+ months retention).

TECHNICAL STACK:
React 18.3.1 + TypeScript 5.5.3 + Vite 5.4.2 + Tailwind CSS 3.4.1 + Lucide React 0.344.0 + Recharts for data visualization
